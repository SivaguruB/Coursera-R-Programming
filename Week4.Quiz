Question 1

+What is produced at the end of this snippet of R code?

	set.seed(1)
	rpois(5, 2)

A vector with the numbers 1, 1, 2, 4, 1


Question 2

What R function can be used to generate standard Normal random variables?

rnorm


Question 3

When simulating data, why is using the `set.seed()` function important?

It ensures that the sequence of random numbers is reproducible.


Question 4

Which function can be used to evaluate the inverse cumulative distribution function for the Poisson distribution?

qpois


Question 5

What does the following code do?

	set.seed(10)
	x <- rbinom(10, 10, 0.5)
	e <- rnorm(10, 0, 20)
	y <- 0.5 + 2 * x + e


Generate data from a Normal linear model


Question 6

What R function can be used to generate Binomial random variables?

rbinom


Question 7


What aspect of the R runtime does the profiler keep track of when an R expression is evaluated?


the function call stack	


Question 8

Consider the following R code

	library(datasets)
	Rprof()
	fit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)
	Rprof(NULL)

(Assume that y, x1, and x2 are present in the workspace.) Without running the code, what percentage of the run time is 
spent in the `lm` function, based on the `by.total` method of normalization shown in `summaryRprof()`?


100%


Question 9

When using `system.time()`, what is the user time?

It is the time spent by the CPU evaluating an expression


Question 10

If a computer has more than one available processor and R is able to take advantage of that, then which of the following
is true when using `system.time()`?

Elapsed time may be smaller than user time
